# 3D Perfume Animation Project

This project is a 3D animation of a perfume bottle moving onto a bookshelf, implemented using WebGL. The animation is interactive, allowing users to start and stop the animation with a button click.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- A modern web browser that supports WebGL.
- Node.js and npm for managing dependencies and running the development server.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that sets up the canvas and UI elements.
- **src/index.js**: The main JavaScript file that initializes the WebGL context and handles the animation logic.
- **src/scene.js**: Contains functions to initialize the scene and manage 3D models.
- **src/perfume.js**: Contains functions to create and manage the perfume bottle model.
- **src/bookshelf.js**: Contains functions to create and manage the bookshelf model.
- **src/floor.js**: Contains functions to create and manage the floor model.

## Code Explanation

### Main JavaScript Logic

The main logic is found in `src/index.js`, which handles the initialization and animation of the 3D scene.

- **Initialization**: The `main` function initializes the WebGL context and sets up the scene with models for the perfume bottle, bookshelf, and floor.
- **Animation**: The `updateAnimation` function handles the animation logic, moving the perfume bottle smoothly onto the bookshelf using an easing function.

### HTML Structure

The HTML file `index.html` sets up the canvas and UI controls for the animation.

- **Canvas**: The `<canvas>` element with the ID `glCanvas` is used for rendering the 3D scene.
- **Controls**: A button with the ID `toggleAnimation` allows users to start and stop the animation.

## How to Use

### Install the Dependencies

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory(Project - cd project).
2. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Development Server**: Run the following command to start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. **Open Your Web Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Building the Application

1. **Create a Production Build**: Run the following command to create a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Serve the Build Directory**: Use a static server to serve the `build` directory. For example, using `http-server`:
   ```bash
   npx http-server ./build
   ```
3. **Open Your Web Browser**: Navigate to the provided URL to view the production version of the application.

## Additional Information

- **Dependencies**: The project uses the `gl-matrix` library for matrix operations, which is included via a CDN in the HTML file.
- **Customization**: You can adjust the animation duration and model positions in `src/index.js` to customize the animation behavior.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
